## Optical Flow Implementation using OpenCV

This project implements optical flow using OpenCV and three different algorithms: Shi-Tomasi, Lucas-Kanade, and Gunner-Farneback. Optical flow is a technique for estimating the motion of objects in a video stream by analyzing the changes in pixel intensities between consecutive frames.

## Installation

To use this project, you will need to have OpenCV installed on your system. You can install OpenCV using pip:
pip install opencv-python

## Results

The output of the optical flow algorithms is a video file that shows the estimated motion vectors overlaid on the original video frames.
